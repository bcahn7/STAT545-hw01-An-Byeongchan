### Homework1
#### Report my process
- Create a New Repo  
A new repo on Github is created and named as STAT545-hw01-An-Byeongchan  
  
- Edit README.md  
I introduced myself editing the README.md.  
I edited in the browser at github.com.  
Also, I pulled from GitHub, edited locally to local files, saved, commited, and pushed the commit to GitHub. 
  

    1. Differently sized headers were put. 
    2. Some words or sentences were italicized or bold. 
    3. Bullet points were used 
    4. A gif was included. 
    5. The main page stat545.com was linked.

What I've learned:   
Within a list, four spaces at the begin of the line indicates the text is to be indented one nesting level. Use four additional spaces for each additional nesting level.  
[STAT545-UBC.github.io/hw01_sample_readme.md](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/STAT545-UBC.github.io/blob/master/hw01_sample_readme.md) This page was useful for testing some Markdown features.
